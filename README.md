ChessGame - Try Catch quest.
=========

This program discovers how Chess pieces fit on a customizable board without threating each other.

To run this program you will need to compile the sources and run it with the following parameters:

ChessGame {col} {rows} {kings} {queens} {bishops} {rooks} {knights} 

For example for a 3x3 board with 2 kings and 1 rook you would invoke it like this:

ChessGame 3 3 2 0 0 1 0 

For a harder problem, a 7Ã—7 board with 2 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Bishops and 1 Knight, you would run the program with this parameters:

ChessGame 7 7 2 2 2 0 1 

That with reply you with more than 2 million boards, and may take a while to print.
